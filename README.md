# EqualizerAPO
Use the EqualizerAPO program to create a unique graphical equalizer for each song played through a media player.

I created this software because I DJ for swing dance and wanted to be able to initialize my set before the dance, then hit "go" and dance for the rest of the evening.

## What is EqualizerAPO?
Ok, so my project isn't actually EqualizerAPO. It's just based on using it and communicating between that application and my media player to auto-DJ (see note above).

EqualizerAPO is actually way cooler than this project and can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/.

## Download
There will soon be a download link here so that you can simply download the .exe & instructions and it should (hopefully) work.

## Supported Media Players
Currently there is one supported media player:
* Zune (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27163)

## Client Side Apps
I want to be able to control this software from my phone. Don't you?
There's [this app](https://github.com/gladclef/EqualizerAPO_Connect) that I'm working on to do this from Windows Phone 8.1.
Maybe someday there will be other supported other platforms, too (let me know if you have something so that I can link to it here!).
